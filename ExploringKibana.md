1. Add the sample web log data to Kibana.

2. Answer the following questions:

    5.479% and 4.11% 
    
    - In the last 7 days, what country produced the majority of the traffic on the website?
    China 306(19.2%)
    
    - Of the traffic that's coming from that country, what time of day had the highest amount of activity?
    12-1p.m.
    - List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type
    css - A CSS file is a cascading style sheet (CSS) file used to format the contents of a webpage.
    deb - A file with the DEB file extension is a Debian Software Package file. They're used mainly in Unix-based operating systems, including Ubuntu and iOS.

    rpm - similar to the deb files, Red Hat Package Manager file that's used to store installation packages on Linux operating system.
    zip - ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression.
    
3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.
     - Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
     Average Bytes: 15709
     Unique visitors: 1
     
     - In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?
The number of unique visitors is very low in comparison to other times. During other times, such low number of unique visitors corresponds with lower number of 
bytes. Could be a sign of a user extracting data, but further research is needed.
